				<h2>About Me:</h2>

				<p>
					I'm a 2nd-year in Lewis and Clarks' Software Development Class<br>
					There, we learned languages in software development (Python, Java)<br>
					and Website Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). My charitible and<br>
					communicative personality led me to a workflow managing position for<br>
					a team project we were assigned. This mean't that my job was to<br>
					help and talk with each of our other branches within the project and<br>
					plan out the general path that the project should pursue in order to<br>
					maximize efficiency.<br>
